This program takes any number of files delimited by either a space, a pipe, or a comma, and an output_type. It then cleans, reorders the data in consistent way and combines it into a sigle CSV file with headers. It then sorts the new CSV based on whatever output type you passed in when the program was run.

output_1: Sorted first by gender then by last name ascending
output_2: Sorted by date of birth ascending
output_3: Sorted by last name descending

Finally each sorted CSV is printed out.

To run the program:
  ruby file_parser.rb

To run the test suite:
  ruby tests/test_suite.rb
